#### Summary
A project that served as coursework for one of my university modules, Programming for Data Science. For this project, we had to use two programming
languages, Python and R, to do the analysis. In the brief for this project, we were told to look at the data for the flights in the US for at least two 
consecutive years. 

Using this data, we were asked to answer 5 questions:
1. When is the best time of day, day of the week, and time of year to fly to minimise delays?
2. Do older planes suffer more delays?
3. How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
4. Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others?
5. Use the available variables to construct a model that predicts delays.
