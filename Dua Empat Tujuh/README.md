A few snippets of the projects I did during my time in Dua Empat Tujuh:

1. Clustering for IMERI: Using various supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques as a demonstration to IMERI on possible applications of machine learning.
2. RAG: A basic RAG pipeline I made using qdrant as a VectorDB.
3. LangGraph: A langgraph agent that was made to assist with SQL querying and generating appropriate graphs for the data it obtained. Includes code for a simple web demo using streamlit.
