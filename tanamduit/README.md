#### Summary
A couple of projects from my time interning for 'tanamduit', a company that makes an app, serving as a platform for users to make investments in mutual
funds, gold, etc. 

**demographics.py** was code made to analyze the cross-sectional data of the company's customers and AUM (Assets Under Management) at the 30th of April 2022.
There, I looked at the popularity of each investment product and the demographics of those who routinely transacted and those who were outliers.

**product_performance.py** was code made to quantify and project the performance of the mutual funds on offer with customers so that the company could know
which mutual funds were being invested in by their customers and potentially cull those that were less popular.

**trx rd apr-jun.py** was made to analyze the transactions for mutual funds in the period of April-June 2022. There, I looked at the dates where buying
and selling of mutual funds peaked, the retention rate of customers from past years, whether new customers were repeatedly/frequently transacting, 
switching behavior, and ranked the popularity of mutual funds on offer.
