#### Summary
This was my first ever programming project that served as the capstone for an online course by HarvardX on Data Science with R. In our capstone project,
we were to make a rudimentary machine learning algorithm for two datasets: one for the MovieLens dataset and another for the CMC dataset.

The MovieLens dataset contains data pertaining to around ten million movies, including the ratings that were given to those movies. We were tasked to 
predict the rating of a movie given the variables provided in the dataset.

The second dataset was a dataset of our own choosing and I chose the CMC (Contraceptive Method Choice) dataset. Here, the target variable was the type
of contraceptive women used and I attempted to make a model that would predict that.
